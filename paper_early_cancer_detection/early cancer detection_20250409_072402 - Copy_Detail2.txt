Title: Early detection of cancer
Author: D Crosby, S Bhatia, KM Brindle, LM Coussens, C Dive
Abstract: Structured Abstract
BACKGROUND
When cancer is detected at the earliest stages, treatment is more effective and survival drastically improves. Yet ~50% of cancers are still only detected at an advanced stage. Improved earlier detection of cancer could substantially increase survival rates. Although recent advances in early detection have saved lives, further innovations and development of early cancer detection approaches are needed. The field is evolving rapidly, owing to advances in biological understanding and an increasing pace of technological progress.
ADVANCES
We highlight five challenges facing the field, current work in those areas, and where more research is needed to make early detection a reality. The first challenge is to build a greater understanding of the biology and behavior of early disease. This will help identify ways to distinguish between consequential, aggressive lesions and inconsequential lesions that will not cause harm. Such insight will be crucial to realizing the potential for early detection to inform treatment decisions and improve survival, while minimizing the risk of overtreatment. Alongside studies in human samples, better models of disease are enabling identification of early signals of tumorigenesis and clarifying the contributions of the immune system and microenvironment to tumor development.
The second challenge is determining the risk of developing cancer. How can we use germline genomic susceptibility, family history, exposures, demographic, and behavioral data to build nuanced risk models to identify who should be tested for cancer and how test results should be interpreted and followed up? Progress is being made to address this challenge through improved understanding of the genomics of cancer risk, integration of that insight with other risk factors, and the development of large-scale population cohorts where risk models can be developed and validated.
The third challenge is finding and validating biomarkers of early cancer. There is considerable difficulty in finding accurate signals of early cancer (which usually exist in very small amounts) amid the noise of normal human physiology. Although progress has historically been slow, many promising early detection markers are emerging, including circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, proteins, exosomes, and cancer metabolites. Advances in data analysis methodologies (such as machine learning) and integration across marker types in multimodal tests are also accelerating progress.
The fourth challenge is technological. It involves both the iterative improvement of existing approaches and the development of disruptive detection technologies that can very sensitively and specifically identify early biological changes, whether in tissue structure, biochemistry, or function. Powerful molecular analytical technologies and advanced imaging and histopathological methods are increasing the ability to sensitively find earlier tumors, while the use of synthetic markers may help to amplify their signal.
The fifth challenge is how to appropriately evaluate early detection approaches. Translation of biological insights into new diagnostic technologies and execution of clinical trials to validate those advances require substantial time and money. We discuss ways in which that process might be improved.
OUTLOOK
For early detection to deliver transformative progress in cancer survival, wider skill sets beyond cancer biology are essential, including engineers, chemists, physicists, technology developers, and behavioral and computer scientists. Integrated, interdisciplinary collaboration is key to bringing new ideas to address the challenges of early cancer detection. We believe that early detection of cancer is approaching a tipping point, as biological insight and technological capacity are increasing at an unprecedented rate and as public and private funders of research are increasingly willing to invest. This Review discusses the current state of the field and suggests constructive ways forward that build on current progress to deliver effective earlier detection of cancer and appropriate intervention.

Title: The future of early cancer detection | Nature Medicine
Author: RC Fitzgerald, AC Antoniou, L Fruk, N Rosenfeld
Abstract: A proactive approach to detecting cancer at an early stage can make treatments more effective, with fewer side effects and improved long-term survival. However, as detection methods become increasingly sensitive, it can be difficult to distinguish inconsequential changes from lesions that will lead to life-threatening cancer. Progress relies on a detailed understanding of individualized risk, clear delineation of cancer development stages, a range of testing methods with optimal performance characteristics, and robust evaluation of the implications for individuals and society. In the future, advances in sensors, contrast agents, molecular methods, and artificial intelligence will help detect cancer-specific signals in real time. To reduce the burden of cancer on society, risk-based detection and prevention needs to be cost effective and widely accessible. Technological advances are producing exquisitely sensitive cancer detection tests. This Review discusses who should be tested, and how—and looks to the future of personalized, risk-based cancer screening.

Title: Nanotechnology for Early Cancer Detection
Author: YE Choi, JW Kwak, JW Park
Abstract: Vast numbers of studies and developments in the nanotechnology area have been conducted and many nanomaterials have been utilized to detect cancers at early stages. Nanomaterials have unique physical, optical and electrical properties that have proven to be very useful in sensing. Quantum dots, gold nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, gold nanowires and many other materials have been developed over the years, alongside the discovery of a wide range of biomarkers to lower the detection limit of cancer biomarkers. Proteins, antibody fragments, DNA fragments, and RNA fragments are the base of cancer biomarkers and have been used as targets in cancer detection and monitoring. It is highly anticipated that in the near future, we might be able to detect cancer at a very early stage, providing a much higher chance of treatment.

Title: Emerging nanomedicines for early cancer detection and improved treatment: Current perspective and future promise
Author: DJ Bharali, SA Mousa
Abstract: The application of nanotechnology to medicine, commonly referred to as ‘nanomedicine’, has the potential to transform our approach to human health and disease. Research at the nanoscale level affords the opportunity to address some of the most confounding human diseases at the molecular level, with the potential for significant improvements in disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Rapid advances and emerging technologies in nanoscale systems, particularly nanoparticles, are having a profound impact on cancer diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. The development of nanoparticulate systems that offer improved chemotherapeutic delivery through increased solubility and sustained retention times is an area of intense focus in nanomedicine. In addition, active targeting of nanoparticles through conjugation of tumor-specific cell surface markers such as tumor-specific antibodies or ligands can enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle drug delivery systems while significantly reducing toxicity. Perhaps some of the most exciting advances in nanomedicine are multifunctional nanoparticulate systems for simultaneous imaging of tumor mass and drug delivery. In a relatively short period of time, nanomedicine has already begun to have a strong presence in the global market. This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress in nanomedicine as it relates specifically to nanoparticles and anticancer drug delivery. Research into different nanoprobes for cancer detection/imaging will also be discussed. Lastly, the future of this growing and dynamic field and its potential impact will be discussed.

Title: The case for early detection | Nature Reviews Cancer
Author: R Etzioni, N Urban, S Ramsey, M McIntosh
Abstract: Early detection represents one of the most promising approaches to reducing the growing cancer burden. It already has a key role in the management of cervical and breast cancer, and is likely to become more important in the control of colorectal, prostate and lung cancer. Early-detection research has recently been revitalized by the advent of novel molecular technologies that can identify cellular changes at the level of the genome or proteome, but how can we harness these new technologies to develop effective and practical screening tests?

Title: Phases of Biomarker Development for Early Detection of Cancer
Author: MS Pepe, R Etzioni, Z Feng, JD Potter
Abstract: Extract
1) Introduction
Recent developments in such areas of research as gene-expression microarrays, proteomics, and immunology offer new approaches to cancer screening (1). The surge in research to develop cancer-screening biomarkers prompted the establishment of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) by the National Cancer Institute (2). The purpose of the EDRN is to coordinate research among biomarker-development laboratories, biomarker-validation laboratories, clinical repositories, and population-screening programs. By coordination of research efforts, the hope is to facilitate collaboration and to promote efficiency and rigor in research.

With the goals of the EDRN in mind, the purpose of this commentary is to define a formal structure to guide the process of biomarker development. We categorize the development into five phases that a biomarker needs to pass through to produce a useful population-screening tool. The phases of research are generally ordered according to the strength of evidence that each provides in favor of the biomarker, from weakest to strongest. In addition, the results of earlier phases are generally necessary to design later phases.

Title: American Cancer Society Guidelines for the Early Detection of Cancer, 2003†
Author: RA Smith, V Cokkinides, HJ Eyre
Abstract: Each January, the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of existing recommendations for early cancer detection, including updates, and/or emerging issues that are relevant to screening for cancer. In 2002, the ACS assembled expert groups to update guidelines for cervical cancer screening and breast cancer screening, and to evaluate new technology for colorectal cancer screening. In November 2002, updated guidelines for cervical cancer screening were published in this journal, and breast cancer screening guidelines will be updated in 2003. In this issue, there is a report of a workshop held to review emerging technology for colorectal cancer screening that resulted in a modification of current previous recommendations for fecal occult blood tests, and revised recommendations for the “cancer-related check-up” in which clinical encounters provide case-finding and health-counseling opportunities. Finally, we provide an update of the most recent data pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening by age, gender, and ethnicity from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

Title: Synthetic biomarkers: a twenty-first century path to early cancer detection | Nature Reviews Cancer
Author: GA Kwong, S Ghosh, L Gamboa, C Patriotis
Abstract: Detection of cancer at an early stage when it is still localized improves patient response to medical interventions for most cancer types. The success of screening tools such as cervical cytology to reduce mortality has spurred significant interest in new methods for early detection (for example, using non-invasive blood-based or biofluid-based biomarkers). Yet biomarkers shed from early lesions are limited by fundamental biological and mass transport barriers — such as short circulation times and blood dilution — that limit early detection. To address this issue, synthetic biomarkers are being developed. These represent an emerging class of diagnostics that deploy bioengineered sensors inside the body to query early-stage tumours and amplify disease signals to levels that could potentially exceed those of shed biomarkers. These strategies leverage design principles and advances from chemistry, synthetic biology and cell engineering. In this Review, we discuss the rationale for development of biofluid-based synthetic biomarkers. We&nbsp;examine how these strategies harness dysregulated features of tumours to amplify detection signals, use tumour-selective activation to increase specificity and leverage natural processing of bodily fluids (for example, blood, urine and proximal fluids) for easy detection. Finally, we highlight the challenges that exist for preclinical development and clinical translation of synthetic biomarker diagnostics. Synthetic biomarkers are an emerging class of diagnostics that amplify disease signals for sensitive and specific detection of early-stage cancers. This Review discusses the rationale and design of biofluid-based synthetic biomarkers as well as translational challenges and future directions.

Title: miRNAs as biomarkers for early cancer detection and their application in the development of new diagnostic tools | BioMedical Engineering OnLine
Author: LJ Galvão-Lima, AHF Morais, RAM Valentim
Abstract: Over the last decades, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important molecules associated with the regulation of gene expression in humans and other organisms, expanding the strategies available to diagnose and handle several diseases. This paper presents a systematic review of literature of miRNAs related to cancer development and explores the main techniques used to quantify these molecules and their limitations as screening strategy. The bibliographic research was conducted using the online databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Science Direct searching the terms “microRNA detection”, “miRNA detection”, “miRNA and prostate cancer”, “miRNA and cervical cancer”, “miRNA and cervix cancer”, “miRNA and breast cancer”, and “miRNA and early cancer diagnosis”. Along the systematic review over 26,000 published papers were reported, and 252 papers were returned after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were considered during this review. The aim of this study is to identify potential miRNAs related to cancer development that may be useful for early cancer diagnosis, notably in the breast, prostate, and cervical cancers. In addition, we suggest a preliminary top 20 miRNA panel according to their relevance during the respective cancer development. Considering the progressive number of new cancer cases every year worldwide, the development of new diagnostic tools is critical to refine the accuracy of screening tests, improving the life expectancy and allowing a better prognosis for the affected patients.

Title: Prevention and early detection of prostate cancer
Author: J Cuzick, MA Thorat, G Andriole, OW Brawley
Abstract: Summary
Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men and the worldwide burden of this disease is rising. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, exercise, and weight control offer opportunities to reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Early detection of prostate cancer by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is controversial, but changes in the PSA threshold, frequency of screening, and the use of other biomarkers have the potential to minimise the overdiagnosis associated with PSA screening. Several new biomarkers for individuals with raised PSA concentrations or those diagnosed with prostate cancer are likely to identify individuals who can be spared aggressive treatment. Several pharmacological agents such as 5α-reductase inhibitors and aspirin could prevent development of prostate cancer. In this Review, we discuss the present evidence and research questions regarding prevention, early detection of prostate cancer, and management of men either at high risk of prostate cancer or diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer.

Title: Liquid biopsies: the future of cancer early detection | Journal of Translational Medicine
Author: S Connal, JM Cameron, A Sala, PM Brennan
Abstract: Cancer is a worldwide pandemic. The burden it imposes grows steadily on a global scale causing emotional, physical, and financial strains on individuals, families, and health care systems. Despite being the second leading cause of death worldwide, many cancers do not have screening programs and many people with a high risk of developing cancer fail to follow the advised medical screening regime due to the nature of the available screening tests and other challenges with compliance. Moreover, many liquid biopsy strategies being developed for early detection of cancer lack the sensitivity required to detect early-stage cancers. Early detection is key for improved quality of life, survival, and to reduce the financial burden of cancer treatments which are greater at later stage detection. This review examines the current liquid biopsy market, focusing in particular on the strengths and drawbacks of techniques in achieving early cancer detection. We explore the clinical utility of liquid biopsy technologies for the earlier detection of solid cancers, with a focus on how a combination of various spectroscopic and -omic methodologies may pave the way for more efficient cancer diagnostics.
